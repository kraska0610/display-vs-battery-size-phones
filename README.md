# display-vs-battery-size-phones

For my MA 705 (Data Science) final project, I chose to scrape phonearena.com's phone listings pages. Information I gathered about individual devices included brand, device name, display size, display resolution, refresh rate, battery size, RAM, storage, and release date.

Although all of this information would be displayed in a table, I was particularly interested in examining the relationship between display size and battery size, with a breakdown by brand. 

According to my scatterplot, there is a clear, positive relationship between display size and battery size, and Apple in particular appears to use smaller batteries across the board than other brands.
